# Twitter_Final_Project

This is my Final Project for Python Class:

Steps to Follow:

1.	Run all Get_Data… python files ( I separated them to run multiple ones at the same time - thought it would be faster)
2.	If you do not want to do step 1, extract the already loaded data from the zip file : "Already Loaded Data".
3.	Once the you have the data, run GUI_sentiment_analysis ( !! Be aware it takes a bit of time to load….!! – it is not super-efficient to load the data unfortunately)
   
   Pointers for GUI: 
   - Be PATIENT with it :') - did not manage to oprimize it.... 
    -	On far left you have a drop down menu to decide which data you want to see.
    -	To show the data click on plot data.
    -	To select another company, first “clear Data” and choose your company.
    -	On the far right you can load all the most negative tweets of the company.


If you have any questions don't hesitate to aks.
